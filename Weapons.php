                    <h2>Ship's weapons</h2>
                    Each ship can be equipped with a variety of energy, kinetic and missile weapons. Most weapons are available in fixed, gimbal or turret versions.
                    <br><br>
                    Acquiring, replacing or removing ship weapons can be done on space stations and carrier ships. All weapons are located in special nests, the size and number of which is determined by the ship manufacturer.

                    Some weapons require ammunition. When you purchase a weapon, its ammunition is immediately fully stocked. The ammunition can be replenished through the main menu of the station, in the “additional services” section on the main page of the settlement's information network.
                    <br>
                    The ship's weapons are organized by class, ranging from 1 to 4, indicating their relative size. Weapons of a lower class can be placed in the cells of a higher class, but not vice versa.

                    <h2>Weapons classification</h2>
                    Each ship can be equipped with different weapons. Most of the weapons are available in variants:
                    <br>
                    — Fixed.
                    <br>
                    — Gimbal-type.
                    <br>
                    — Turret-type.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to factory-produced weapons, there are also modernized versions provided by different superpowers. Each such device has both advantages and disadvantages.

                    <h2>Fixed weaponry</h2>
                    Fixed weapons have the highest damage of any weapon type with this type of mount in the game. They require high flying skills and a maneuverable ship (not necessarily fast, the main thing is that he had time to “follow” the target), otherwise they become practically useless - not keeping up with the target, you either will not do damage at all, or you will, but from time to time, when the enemy makes a mistake and allows you to shoot at yourself. They have the most minimal automatic aiming (no more than two degrees of deviation from the sight), but this minimal aiming is nevertheless extremely useful for accurate firing at long distances and for focusing certain modules on the ship, and as a consequence, fixed weapons - the most accurate and long-range in the game, can safely reach the enemy at a distance at which turrets or weapons on gimbal suspension will be practically useless.

                    <h2>Gimbal-type weaponry</h2>
                    Gimbal-type mount is recommended for beginners and bounty hunters, as it does not require much effort from the pilot to use, while the damage remains at a decent level. The main disadvantage of this type of mount is that the weapon on the gimbal hits the enemy the worse, the farther away from you he is, at the maximum distance the effectiveness is reduced to zero. This is due to the fact that the barrel of the weapon with this type of mount when firing, although it is automatically aimed, but at the same time a little “ride” from side to side, the farther the target, the more this effect will be noticeable, and the less often the gimbal will hit. The easiest way to observe this effect is to use beam lasers - the direct beam will not hit the target exactly in one place, but will “ride” on it back and forth.

                    <h2>Turret-type weaponry</h2>
                    Turret-type weapons are fully automated, with turrets capable of rotating up to 180° in either direction and target the enemy without any help from the pilot. Extremely unpredictable and peculiar weapons, possessing their own will and mind, sometimes so smart and shrewd that they “unmistakably” determine the enemy aboard “that ship from the Federation Navy in the wing with 6 more fighters”. The damage of these weapons is also very lame - as a rule, all types of turrets have the highest damage in their class and segment. For example, in the Class 1 Pulse Lasers segment, a turret mount will do the least damage. However, a Class 2 Pulse Turret, although it will be the weakest in its segment, will still be more powerful than the strongest Class 1. So don't relax and underestimate their damage - the 3rd class turrets are as powerful as any of the 2nd class turrets, and are self-pointing, even though they are weaker than other weapons of that size.

                    <h2>Damage types</h2>
                    All weapons deal certain types of damage with their own advantages and disadvantages. There are special types of armor against some of them. In the Elite universe, there are 3 basic types of damage to material objects.

                    <h2>Kinetic damage</h2>
                    Kinetic damage is actually a physical characteristic of the kinetic energy imparted to the target by the kinetic energy imparted to the surface by the striking element when it is fired. As a consequence, ammunition is required for weapons that inflict this type of damage. In weightlessness, kinetic energy is not expended to cover the distance, as it is not subject to atmospheric resistance.
                    This type of damage is more effective against the target's armor and hull than against shields. There is a special armor that increases resistance to this type of damage - a composite with a reactive surface that dampens the kinetic energy of the projectile at the moment it touches the surface.

                    <h2>Multi-barrelled gun</h2>
                    Multi-barrelled gun is a rapid-fire analog of a conventional cannon. It works on the principle of Gatling machine gun. The projectiles detonate on contact with the surface, but with a smaller radius than that of a large cannon. When firing into the forward (frontal) part of the enemy ship, has an increased chance to break the glass of the cockpit. Very high ammunition and a fairly large magazine.

                    <h2>Fragment Cannon</h2>
                    A Fragment Cannon is a kinetic type of weapon. It fires bursts of 12 projectiles, much like a shotgun. While each individual projectile has low damage, it can quickly fire three bursts of 12 in rapid succession. It only fires 3 rounds per 1 clip, each of which is a bundle of smaller charges, dealing massive damage. Effectiveness drops with distance, as the “shot” spreads out and at greater distances fewer of them hit the target.

                    <h2>Railgun</h2>
                    A railgun is a powerful electromagnetic weapon that deals both thermal and kinetic damage. Railguns consume a large amount of energy and generate a significant amount of heat with each shot, but can do serious damage to the target. The magazine holds only 1 round and must be reloaded after each shot. The railgun is also slightly homing in on the target. This makes it possible to hit a single point with multiple railguns.

                    <h2>Cannon</h2>
                    The Cannon is a large-caliber artillery cannon (analog of a recoilless cannon from real life) that fires large-caliber shells. On contact with the surface, the projectile detonates, which, along with high armor penetration, causes great damage to the ship's modules. The velocity of the projectile is medium. Since the gun is very similar in principle to the plasma gas pedal, it is a very good cheap training tool.

                    <h2>Thermal damage</h2>
                    Thermal damage is actually the effect of spot heating of a surface to very high temperatures. Weapons that deal this type of damage usually generate a large amount of heat, heating both the weapon itself and the enemy surface.
                    Due to the high melting point of the materials from which ship armor (hull) is made, thermal damage is more effective against enemy shields than against armor (hull). There is a special armor that increases resistance to this type of damage - a composite with a mirror surface that reflects part of the heat ray into the surrounding space, thereby reducing the negative impact.

                    <h2>Beam Laser</h2>
                    The Beam Laser is a type of laser weapon that fires a continuous beam. It deals high thermal damage, making it very effective against shields and less effective against hulls. Heat output is average. Like all laser weapons, it does not require ammunition, but if it overheats, the barrel must be cooled down, after which it can continue firing. Highest power consumption and damage among other laser weapons.

                    <h2>Pulse Laser</h2>
                    The Pulse Laser is a monopulse laser weapon that fires a brief beam at regular intervals. It deals medium thermal damage, which makes it effective against shields and less effective against hulls. Heat output is low. As with all laser weapons, it does not require ammunition, but if it overheats, the barrel must be cooled down before it can continue firing.

                    <h2>Burst Laser</h2>
                    The Burst Laser is a multi-pulse laser gun that fires short bursts of beams. It deals medium thermal damage, which makes it effective against shields and less effective against hull (armor). Heat output is low compared to other laser weapons. As with all laser weapons, it does not require ammunition, but in case of overheating it is necessary to cool the barrel, after which you can continue firing.

                    <h2>Plasma Accelerator</h2>
                    The Plasma Accelerator is a fixed-mounted energy weapon that fires plasma discharges. The Plasma Accelerator is a fixed-mounted energy weapon that fires plasma discharges. Plasma gas pedals are equally effective against both shields and hulls. The weapon is not suitable for use on small ships due to its large mounts, high power consumption and heat output. Requires ammunition. 5 shells per round.

                    <h2>Explosion damage</h2>
                    Explosion damage is effective against enemy armor (hull) and highly ineffective against shields. Since battles take place in airless space in weightlessness, the blast wave does not inflict all the damage it could in the atmosphere. This type of damage is caused by missiles, torpedoes, and mines. The blast wave is also capable of damaging weapons and modules in external equipment mounts without a direct hit.

                    <h2>Missile Rack</h2>
                    The Missile Rack is a weapon module that launches small caliber unguided rockets, explosive-type warheads. When unguided rockets are launched, they will travel in a straight line and fly until they explode, or are destroyed on impact with an obstacle/target, weapons fire, or a point defense turret. Unguided missiles fly faster and do more damage than homing missiles, and are most effective against ship hulls without shields.

                    <h2>Torpedo Pylon</h2>
                    The Torpedo Pylon is a device for launching heat-seeking torpedoes. After launching a homing torpedo (requires no prior targeting, the torpedo is guided by the heat signature of the selected target), it can only be reloaded at the station. Causes tremendous explosive damage to the target hull. The torpedo itself can be shot down by the enemy's ship's armament or electronic suppression system.
