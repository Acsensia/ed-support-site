                    <h2>Elite: Dangerous</h2>
                    Elite: Dangerous is a multiplayer space epic and the fourth installment in the legendary Elite series of games, the longest running space simulation series in history. Elite: Dangerous is developed and released by Frontier Developments, under the direction of director David Braben.
                    <br><br>
                    Elite: Dangerous is a whole universe, there is no one thing you can do here, to reach the highest rank of “Elite” you will have to try all areas of occupation.
                    <br><br>
                    Elite: Dangerous brings a modern look and new features to the gaming world of the Elite universe. It is the first game in the series to feature multiplayer online mode in a huge 1:1 scale simulated Milky Way galaxy based on real scientific principles, up-to-date scientific data and theories.

                    Elite: Dangerous is also one of the first major titles to offer full virtual reality support with an exceptionally immersive experience in an all-encompassing universe, where each pilot on their own game platform can impact the same shared galaxy events with an interactive overarching narrative through simulated background events.
                    <br><br>
                    Like previous Elite games, the events of Elite: Dangerous take place in the fictional Elite universe, and begin in the year 3300 AD (which corresponds to the 2014 release date, which is 1286 years later) and 50 years after the events of Frontier: First Encounters. The targoids introduced in the first Elite games are also back.
                    <br><br>
                    The game starts in a Sidewinder spaceship and a small amount of credits in the account. Trading, piracy, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, exploration, salvage, passenger transportation - these are the main components in the game on the way to fame and fortune.

                    <h2>Key Features</h2>
                    <li>A huge Milky Way galaxy made in 1:1 scale and based on real scientific principles, modern scientific data and theories. It is created through a combination of procedural generation and design direction. There are about 400 billion star systems in the galaxy.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>An exciting, evolving galaxy with a dynamic social order, economy and its own historical events, allowing pilots to band together and change the history of the Milky Way together.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The free-form game allows everyone to choose who to become: an evil pirate, a spy, a peaceful merchant, an explorer, a soldier, or a combination of these roles.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>There are no rigid classes or skill levels here, strength is determined by ship equipment and pilot skill.</li>

                    <li>User actions can change the narrative and history of humanity. Events such as pirate battles, participation in community goals, and defense of territories leave their mark on the galaxy.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Over 30 different ships with customization options.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Ground vehicles, such as the Scarab or Scorpion, to explore planets and their moons</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Elite Dangerous's flight model has Newtonian physics with a clever flight control system that is more intuitive than fighting enemies at great distances. Space battles based on Newtonian physics (ships will keep moving if you don't interfere with the controls, but without the use of orbital mechanics, formerly too superior to past technology).</li>

                    <h2>An evolving universe</h2>
                    Elite Dangerous simulates the vast Milky Way galaxy, on a 1:1 scale, which evolves in real time. The galaxy is based on real scientific principles, up-to-date scientific data and theories.

                    As pilots explore the galaxy, different factions will spread their influence further into star systems, colonizing planets and building space stations. Pilots can also participate in this process by completing missions for a particular minor faction to increase that faction's influence in a particular system. This can eventually lead to wars or other socio-political events. Pilots can continue to help their chosen faction by participating in these wars. In addition to warfare, pilots can also influence small factions in star systems in other ways, such as through trade missions to cause an “economic boom”.

                    It is important to note that while changing policy in one system can be accomplished by a single pilot, being in a group of pilots where everyone is striving for the same common goal will make it much easier to change the political side of the system, especially as the influence of the chosen faction increases.
                    <br><br>
                    New real-time stations are slowly being built. These developments open up new opportunities for pilots, such as Community Objectives. Stations under construction or being rebuilt need to get the resources and workers needed for construction, which becomes a major target for piracy and increases the demand for bounty hunting. In addition, the alien race of Targoids has returned, and the secrets of the ancient Guardians can also be discovered.
                    <br><br>
                    Each user, regardless of the platform used (PC, Xbox or PS) influences the overall economy and politics of the game's universe. The game's AI characters also participate in the life of the inhabited space.
