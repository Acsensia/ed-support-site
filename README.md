# ed-support-site
A video game site with support info developed with the goal of getting a high mark for my uni assignment

- Video Game introduction through text blocks with images, gifs, image galleries (‘switching’ left or right between a group of images) and drop-down info blocks (pushing a button from a group of buttons and thus making the site display the block of info associated with that particular button)
- Dynamic display of in-game items with their respective characteristics and images in a collection, with options of searching by name and filtering the results by certain value (for example, showing only spaceships of the ‘middle’ size and ‘freighter’ role); the results are divided into pages, the amount shown on each page can be customized (for example, from 6 to 24 items per page with a step of 6); each item can be clicked to pull up a page with detailed information specific to that select item
- All the information on the items themselves, their attributes, detailed descriptions and images are stored in a MySQL database, with JS and PHP being used to asynchronously access it and pull the data that the site needs at a given moment of time; the ‘detailed description’ part of an item is represented by a table with a special structure designed to make adding additional, possibly multiple paragraphs and/or bullet lists easy and frictionless; the possibility of there being no paragraphs / bullet lists has also been taken into consideration
- A statistical graph generator that uses the data about the in-game items described above in order to create a bar graph displaying the spread of a certain value between the individual items, with each individual item having its own bar; the group of items being displayed can also be filtered by certain values (for example, generating a graph with only the values of spaceships built by a certain manufacturer)
- Access to the MySQL database from the site using jq Grid (including searching, filtering, adding, deleting and editing entries)
