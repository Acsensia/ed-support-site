                    <h3>General information</h3>
                    A ship is a character's primary place of residence. They are used for space travel, combat, cargo transportation and many other tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    At the moment there are 6 types of fighters in different modifications and 38 ships in the game.
                    <br>
                    Ships are made in shipyards of different manufacturers, each ship has its own unique style. Most ships have their own basic purpose, chosen by the shipbuilder when the ship was created: cargo, combat, passenger and multi-purpose.
                    <br><br>
                    The pilot himself can choose what modules to equip his ships with, improve the basic equipment, equip them to perform the functions required by the pilot: trade, piracy, bounty hunting, smuggling, asteroid mining, deep space exploration or various missions.

                    <h2>«Hard-working ships for hard-working people.»</h2>
                    Lakon Spaceways is a ship builder specializing in rugged vessels for cargo transport and deep space exploration. The history of this company is much longer than most others. It built its first transport ship on Earth in the twenty-sixth century.
                    Early models of these ships were characterized by the fact that they could be easily repaired away from port. Despite the advent of inexpensive repair shops, they are still known for this characteristic today.
                    In 3303, Lakon began cooperating with the Alliance in the production of warships in response to the growing threat from the Targoids. By 3304, the Type-10 Defender, Alliance Chieftain, Alliance Crusader, and Alliance Challenger had been built during this partnership.
                    Lakon ships are both praised and scolded for their unassuming but practical appearance, shaped more by considerations of function than aesthetics. Proponents of the crude look of Lakon ships usually say that a ship should look like a ship, not an abstract sculpture.

                    <h2>Freighters</h2>
                    Freighters are slow, bulky and lightly armored, but have very large cargo carrying capabilities. Suitable for both traders and smugglers.

                    <h3>Keelback</h3>
                    A ruggedized freighter based on the Type-6 Transporter, but designed to deliver through hotspots. The Keelback carries two medium sockets on board in addition to the two small ones from the Type-6, but its most unique feature is its ability to mount a fighter hangar. The Keelback's armor and shields have also been beefed up compared to the Type-6, making it a suitable option for traders who plan to fly unguarded.

                    <h3>Type-7 Transporter</h3>
                    The Type-7 Transporter, formerly known as the “Freighter 3”, is a large and lightly armed freighter, one of a line of Type freighters. The other two are the smaller Type-6 Transporter, and the Type-9 Heavy freighter. While the Type-7 Transporter is capable of fending off small ships, it was not designed for combat, so it is recommended to leave the danger zone as quickly as possible in the event of an armed engagement.

                    <h3>Type-9 Heavy</h3>
                    The Type-9 Heavy is one of the largest freighters on the market. Although it is inferior to the Imperial Cutter in terms of cargo capacity, the Type-9 is significantly cheaper and does not require Imperial Fleet rank to purchase. In addition, with the ability to install a fighter bay, this model is popular with merchants who want to protect their cargo from thieves.

                    <h2>Exploration ships</h2>
                    Exploration ships have long jump ranges, capacious fuel tanks for ships of this size, and must be equipped with a lot of low-class equipment to increase jump range. These ships are designed to carry many of the scanners needed on an expedition without the need for constant refueling with fuel tanks when flying long distances. Exploration ships are typically specially outfitted multi-purpose ships such as the Asp Explorer or Diamondback Explorer.

                    <h3>Diamondback Explorer</h3>
                    The Diamondback Explorer, the larger sibling of the Diamondback Scout, is also a dual-purpose ship focused on combat and exploration. The Explorer's outstanding firepower and nesting system make it more versatile than the Scout, while its longer jump range and superior thermal efficiency are great for explorers.

                    <h3>Asp Scout</h3>
                    This versatile ship has the same hull as its Asp Explorer counterpart, but due to its reduced overall mass it has greater maneuverability. Because of this, however, the ship is equipped with fewer nests and is therefore less battleworthy than the Explorer. But thanks to the same jump range, the Scout is still of interest to first-timers.

                    <h3>Asp Explorer</h3>
                    The Asp Explorer is often marketed as the perfect ship for pilots picking up their first Multi-Crew ship. Its long jump range and wide cockpit lantern with good visibility have earned this Lakon Spaceways creation popularity among explorers, but the versatility of this model also makes it a great option for tradesmen and combat pilots.

                <div>
                    <h2>Combat ships</h2>
                    Combar ships are generally superior to other ships (when the size of the ship being compared is the same) in terms of speed, maneuverability, and armor. The exception to this may be larger ships, which have more gun mounts but pay the price in mobility.

                    <h3>Alliance Chieftain</h3>
                    The Alliance Chieftain is not only a threat in combat, but also capable of evading enemy fire. Lacon Spaceways provided the ship with high maneuverability and an impressive armament that allows the Chieftain to easily fend for itself. The three internal combat bays can accommodate shield storage as well as module and hull reinforcements.

                    <h3>Alliance Challenger</h3>
                    Alliance Challenger is nothing but a modified model of Alliance Chieftain. The Challenger has an impressive number of gun slots, making it a formidable opponent. Though heavier than its relatives, the Challenger also features the maneuverability characteristic of the Chieftain. The Challenger is equipped with stronger armor than the Chieftain, making it able to hold out longer against superior enemy forces.

                    <h3>Type-10 Defender</h3>
                    The Alliance commissioned Lakon Spaceways to build the versatile Type-10 Defender, and to create it, the company had to completely redesign the Type-9 concept. The resulting vessel surpasses the Type-9 in speed, acceleration and maneuverability, and boasts a better nest layout. The ship was originally conceived as a combat vessel, but its spacious cargo hold makes it equally suitable for traders.
